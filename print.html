        <h1>InDesign/Print</h1>
        
        <p>I don't have a big interest in print layout or print design but I have to admit that the applications are pretty neat. I have a new appreciation for print design in general but I didn't really have any big ideas for this project. I went by the book but I think it still turned out nicely. I've seen resumes created in InDesign and they all look pretty great but I don't really have a big passion or any inspirations for it. I should probably start thinking of how to design a resume using InDesign just because it seems kind of like a mandatory thing for designers in general.
